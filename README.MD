# Node.js Application

This is a Node.js application connected to MongoDB, using MongoDB Compass for database management. You can make requests to the application routes using tools like Postman.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version x.x.x)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (for testing API requests)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a configuration file:**

   Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) in the root directory of your project and add your `jwtPrivateKey`. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "jwtPrivateKey": "your_jwt_private_key_here"
   }
   ```

   A JWT key is a secret string used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It ensures that the token was created by your server and hasn't been altered. It's crucial to keep this key secure and private.

4. **Run the application:**

   Start your application by running:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

5. **Testing the API:**

   You can test your API routes using Postman. For example, you can send GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE requests to your defined routes.
